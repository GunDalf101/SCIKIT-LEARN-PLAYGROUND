# 🧪 Scikit-Learn Playground

Welcome to the **Scikit-Learn Playground**, a mini-project space where I experiment with core machine learning concepts using real-world datasets. This repository includes projects focused on classification and regression, powered by Python and scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Projects Included

### 💓 Heart Disease Classification
Predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical data.
* **Type**: Classification
* **Tech**: scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
* **Highlights**:
   * Data cleaning & preprocessing
   * Feature selection
   * Training classifiers (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM)
   * Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

### 🏗️ Bulldozer Price Prediction
Predicts the sale price of bulldozers using historical auction data.
* **Type**: Regression
* **Tech**: scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
* **Highlights**:
   * Handling missing values
   * Feature engineering
   * Model training (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
   * Evaluation using RMSE and R²

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
